Now that the MVP is connected to Firebase, I want you to implement the core fitness app features fully.

Build real working functionality, not placeholders.
Use Firestore for data storage, Firebase Storage for images, and Context for user state.

Here's the list of features to implement:

🏋️ Workout System

Display available workout plans.

Auto-adjust workouts based on previous performance (progressive overload logic).

Track completed workouts (date, sets, reps, weights used).

Timer for sets and rest periods (visual + audio cues).

✍️ Workout Logging

After completing a workout, log details to Firestore.

Allow editing past logs if needed.

🥗 Nutrition Tracking

Log meals, calories, macros daily.

Log water intake (goal vs. actual).

Weekly summary of calories/macros consumed.

🍳 Smart AI Meal Plans (Mock for Now)

Generate a weekly meal plan based on user preferences (mock using local functions or JSON for now).

📊 Progress & Analytics

Graphs and charts for:

Workout volume over time.

Calories consumed over time.

Sleep hours and stress/mood levels over time.

🗓️ Calendar View

View past workouts and nutrition logs on a monthly calendar.

Click a date to view the log details.

😴 Wellness Tracking

Daily logging of:

Sleep hours

Sleep quality (1–10)

Fatigue level (1–10)

Mood/stress level (1–10)

📸 Progress Photos

Allow users to upload photos (Firebase Storage).

Display photos in a timeline sorted by date.

🧠 Habit Tracking

Track key habits:

Water intake

Junk food avoidance

Sleep consistency

Workout consistency

Show streaks (e.g., 5 days of hydration goal hit = badge).

🏆 Gamification

Award badges for:

PRs hit

Workout streaks

Habit consistency

🔄 Offline Support

Ensure Firestore caching is used properly so the app works offline.

🔒 Security

Double-check Firestore security rules.

✨ Important

Implement real functionality — no mock data anymore.

Make all features interact with Firestore or local cache properly.

Keep the UI clean and simple (text, modals, basic buttons if needed).

Keep code modular and organized (components, services, hooks, utils).
